# Binius

Implementations of the block-level testing based polynomial commitment scheme for small characteristic fields described in *[Succinct Arguments over Towers of Binary Fields](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1784)*. The field and utils crate have been taken as is from the original binius repo, developed by the team at [Irreducible](https://www.irreducible.com).
